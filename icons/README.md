# Plugin Icon

Place a PNG icon here named `custom-smb-shares.png`.

## Requirements
- Recommended size: 512x512 (CA resizes to 96x96 internally)
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Theme: Should represent file sharing / network shares

## Suggested Icons
You can use a free icon from:
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/share-alt) - The `share-alt` icon
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=network%20share)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/network-share)

## Note
The CA template also specifies `<IconFA>share-alt</IconFA>` as a fallback for Unraid 6.7+.
